<h1><strong>About me</strong></h1>
<p>Hey guys , my name is Cvetan Karchev and I'm from Bulgaria. I'm a QA Automation Lead and I'm educating young talents to became automation engineers in IT Academy. <br /><br />I decided to share my automation framework with everybody, so I can help others to learn how to do it. In your lifetime it comes time to give something back. Through so many years I've learned so much and now I want to give something back to the society. All I want from you is to do the same when the time comes. </p>
